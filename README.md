# Bloghead

WIP. Goal is to eventually become a user-friendly static site generator that:

- Uses an SQLite database per site instead of collections of flat files
- Has a traditional web-based CMS interface
- Simplifies deployment to popular targets (GH/GL/SRHT Pages, Tilde/SDF-likes via rsync, etc.)
- Acts reasonably like a desktop program, with proper .bloghead filetype association

The average computer-literate person deserves to own their whole blog
publishing software & data in $current_year!

This also doubles as my daily therapy session to recover from workday-induced
architectureastronomyphobia.
